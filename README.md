# Code Refactor Starter Code
# 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor

This was the first Challenge. The assignment was to clean up some code for an outdated webpage. We added accessibility feaatures, updated the semantics, consolidated repetative code on style sheet, deleted some unecessary classes on html sheet, made sure the navigation links worked in the header, and improved the flow and organization of the style sheet code for ease of maintenance.

Update: had trouble uploading links to meet assignment requirements. Here are the links for the 1xt challenge assignment:
